### Hi there, all the collegues, students and scientists. 👋

I am Sebahattin Serhat Turgut, a Postdoctoral researcher at Techinical University of Denmark and Suleyman Demirel University.
I am also an undergraduate computer engineering student 👦🏻💪🏻.

I mainly study on the following topics. 
- Mechanistic understanding/modelling of food processes systems, 
- Novel food production technologies, 
- System design/optimisation of food processes, 
- Statistical modelling/learning.
However, as time goes by, I feel that I start working more on digitalization.

I am sharing some of my course contents, scripts that I used for my scientific papers, etc. 
Follow me also on Linked, ReseachGate, GoogleScholar.
